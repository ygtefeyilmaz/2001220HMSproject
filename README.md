I couldn't implement the location kit.

I tried to get country codes from Open Charge Map API using retrofit but my app was crashing so i put some mock values to spinner. You can see the retrofit code i wrote, i would appriciate receiving feedback about it.

When an user logs out and tries to sign in again, HMS Core automatically signs the same user in. But log out function works according to App Gallery Connect Auth Service Users section. When user log out and sign in again, last sign in time changes.
